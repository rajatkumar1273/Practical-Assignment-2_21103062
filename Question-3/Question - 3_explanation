Question :-

Consider an array, “A: 27, 17, 02, 13, 19, 07, 18”. 
Write a program to sort this array using merge sort algorithm.

Explanation :-

In this question, we are provided with an array and we have to sort this array using merge sort algorithm.

The 'merge()' function takes three indices 'left', 'mid', and 'right' and merges the two subarrays 'arr[left..mid]' and 'arr[mid+1..right]' 
into a single sorted subarray. It first creates two temporary arrays 'L' and 'R' to hold the left and right subarrays, 
and then iteratively compares the elements in 'L' and 'R' and copies the smaller element to the merged subarray 'arr'. 
After one of the subarrays is fully copied, the remaining elements in the other subarray are copied to 'arr'.

The merge_sort() function takes three arguments arr, left, and right and recursively sorts the subarray arr[left..right] using the merge sort algorithm. If the subarray has length greater than 1, it finds the middle index mid and recursively sorts the left subarray arr[left..mid] and the right subarray `arr[mid+1..
